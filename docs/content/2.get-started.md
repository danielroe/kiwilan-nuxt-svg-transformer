# Getting Started

## Installation

Using SVG transformer module in your Nuxt app is only one command away. ✨

Add `nuxt-svg-transformer` as a development dependency to your project:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add nuxt-svg-transformer -D
```
```bash [npm]
npm i nuxt-svg-transformer --save-dev
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-svg-transformer -D
```
::

Add the module to `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    // https://nuxt-svg-transformer.netlify.app/get-started
    'nuxt-svg-transformer',
  ]
})
```

Now you can put your SVG files into `assets/icons/svg` folder and use them in your Vue components.

::alert{type="info"}
You can change `assets/icons` directory with `assetsDir` option in `nuxt.config` file.
::

::alert{type="success"}
You can now start using `<svg-icon>` components in your Nuxt app ✨
::

## Configuration

Add an `svgTransformer` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    // https://nuxt-svg-transformer.netlify.app/get-started
    'nuxt-svg-transformer',
  ],
  svgTransformer: {
    // Options
  }
})
```

See the [svg configuration](/configuration) for all available options and features to customize.

## Why

The main module of Nuxt 3 to manage icons is [nuxt-modules/icon](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon), with this module you will be able to use directly SVGs from different libraries without importing, you can also registering Vue components to have custom SVGs. If you want to use SVG from library [nuxt-modules/icon](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/icon) can be very interesting for you!

Module [gitFoxCode/nuxt-icons](https://github.com/gitFoxCode/nuxt-icons) have a similar behavior of `nuxt-svg-transformer` module, the main difference is that [gitFoxCode/nuxt-icons](https://github.com/gitFoxCode/nuxt-icons) directly imports SVGs. If you just want to import SVG, try this module!

With `nuxt-svg-transformer`, `svg` aren't directly load from original file but from cache files, `name` is typed to avoid errors, keep native SVG with `fill`/`width`/`height` and you have some options to manage your SVG. It's useful if you want to manage your SVG as icons, without using a library, and without using a custom loader.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm upgrade nuxt-svg-transformer
```
```bash [npm]
npm up nuxt-svg-transformer
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn upgrade nuxt-svg-transformer
```
::

- Try recreating lock-file:

```bash
npx nuxt@latest upgrade --force
```

- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kiwilan/nuxt-svg-transformer/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
