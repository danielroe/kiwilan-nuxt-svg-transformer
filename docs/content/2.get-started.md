# Getting Started

Using SVG transformer module in your Nuxt app is only one command away. ✨

Add `nuxt-svg-transformer` as a development dependency to your project:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add nuxt-svg-transformer -D
```
```bash [npm]
npm i nuxt-svg-transformer --save-dev
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-svg-transformer -D
```
::

Add the module to `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'nuxt-svg-transformer',
  ]
})
```

Now you can put your SVG files into `assets/icons/svg` folder and use them in your Vue components.

::alert{type="info"}
You can change `assets/icons` directory with `assetsDir` option in `nuxt.config` file.
::

::alert{type="success"}
You can now start using `<svg-icon>` components in your Nuxt app ✨
::

## Configuration

Add an `svgTransformer` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
svgTransformer: {
  // Options
}
```

See the [svg configuration](/configuration) for all available options and features to customize.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm upgrade nuxt-svg-transformer
```
```bash [npm]
npm up nuxt-svg-transformer
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn upgrade nuxt-svg-transformer
```
::

- Try recreating lock-file:

```bash
npx nuxt@latest upgrade --force
```

- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kiwilan/nuxt-svg-transformer/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
